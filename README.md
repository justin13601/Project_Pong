# Project_Pong
Project_Pong is a simple re-creation of the classic Pong Arcade Game.


## Game History
Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972.


## Instructions
Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. Players compete against others controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. 

Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other person and it hits their "goal."


## Game Controls
This is a 2 player game with "Player 1" controlling the paddle on the left and "Player 2" controlling the paddle on the right. 

Player 1 Controls:
        Key "W" = Moves Paddle UP
        Key "S" = Moves Paddle DOWN
        
Player 2 Controls:
        Key "P" = Moves Paddle UP
        Key "L" = Moves Paddle DOWN


## Features
An additional "Colour Mode" is available where the ball changes colours while moving and displays a rainbow pattern. Colours change quick and form a flashing effect. WARNING: This effect may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. Player discretion is advised.

Pause and Resume buttons present to allow players to pause and resume their Pong session.

Open and Save scores feature available to allow players to save their current game progress or resume a different game progress. Enables users to save and return to the game while not clearing scores.

The Reset button resets the current game and clears any stored scores. A notification shows prior to warn the players before clearing scores.
